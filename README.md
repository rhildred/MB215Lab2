This is an SMS BOT. I got the simulator user interface for the web from a student of mine, [Pat Wilken](https://patwilken.me/).

To Run the code here:

1. get your focus in the window with setup.py press ctrl-f5
2. get your focus in the files that start with a number - press ctrl-f5

## Lab Questions

1. Add counting the number of tries to the over and under game
2. Make a rock, paper scissors game using the pattern from last week's array question
3. Make an odds and evens game. You will need to research the rules.
